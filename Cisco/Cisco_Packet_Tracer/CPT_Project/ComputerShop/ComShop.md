This is a sample computer shop setup I created using `Cisco Packet Tracer`. The goal is to establish a computer shop-like environment, serving as a practice to enhance my network skills. This setup includes a **_server_**, **_router_**, **_switch_**, **_PC_**, **_cables_**, and additional devices such as a **_tablet_**, **_cloud (internet)_**, and **_modem_**.
